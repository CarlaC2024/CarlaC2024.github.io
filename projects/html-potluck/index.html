        <h4>SYNOPSIS</h4>
        <p>

            On the lush alien world of Pandora live the Na'vi, beings who
            appear primitive but are highly evolved. Because the planet's
            environment is poisonous, human/Na'vi hybrids, called Avatars,
            must link to human minds to allow for free movement on Pandora.
            Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paralyzed former Marine, becomes
            mobile again through one such Avatar and falls in love with a
            Na'vi woman (Zoe Saldana). As a bond with her grows, he is 
            drawn into a battle for the survival of her world.

        <h4>SYNOPSIS</h4>
        <p>

            In 1940s South Carolina, mill worker Noah Calhoun
            (Ryan Gosling) and rich girl Allie (Rachel McAdams) 
            are desperately in love. But her parents don't approve.
            When Noah goes off to serve in World War II, it seems
            to mark the end of their love affair. In the interim,
            Allie becomes involved with another man (James Marsden).
            But when Noah returns to their small town years later,
            on the cusp of Allie's marriage, it soon becomes clear
            that their romance is anything but over.
