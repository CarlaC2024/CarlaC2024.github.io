                of time with their babies and
                infants. Young adult orangutans
                frequently socialize with other
                orangutans of the same age, but
                occasionally ‘visit’ their mothers
                until around 15 to 18 years old.</h4>

                It’s estimated that there are fewer than 7,500 Sumatran 
                orangutans left in the wild, which makes the Rainforest
                Alliance’s Indonesian work in palm oil certification and 
                carbon sequestration—both measures that are helping to protect
                orangutan habitat—vitally important.</h4>
