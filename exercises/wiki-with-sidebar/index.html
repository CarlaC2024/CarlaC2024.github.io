                <p>
                    A fairy (also fay, fae, fey, fair folk, or faerie) is a
                    type of mythical being or legendary creature, generally 
                    described as anthropomorphic, found in the folklore of 
                    multiple European cultures (including Celtic, Slavic, 
                    Germanic, and French folklore), a form of spirit, often
                    with metaphysical, supernatural,
                    or preternatural qualities.

                    Myths and stories about fairies do not have a single 
                    origin, but are rather a collection of folk beliefs 
                    from disparate sources. Various folk theories about
                    the origins of fairies include casting them as 
                    either demoted angels or demons in a Christian 
                    tradition, as deities in Pagan belief systems, 
                    as spirits of the dead, as prehistoric precursors 
                    to humans, or as spirits of nature.

                    The label of fairy has at times applied only to specific 
                    magical creatures with human appearance, magical powers,
                    and a penchant for trickery. At other times it has been 
                    used to describe any magical creature, such as goblins 
                    and gnomes. Fairy has at times been used as an adjective,
                    with a meaning equivalent to "enchanted" or "magical". 
                    It is also used as a name for the place these beings come
                    from, the land of Fairy.

                <h3>Etymology</h3>
                <p>
                    The English fairy derives from the Early Modern English
                    faerie, meaning 'realm of the fays'. Faerie, in turn,
                    derives from the Old French form faierie, a derivation 
                    from faie (from Vulgar Latin fata, 'the fates'), with 
                    the abstract noun suffix -erie.

                    In Old French romance, a faie or fee was a woman skilled 
                    in magic, and who
                    knew the power and virtue of words, of stones, 
                    and of herbs.[3]

                    Fairy was used to represent: an illusion or enchantment; 
                    the land of the 
                    Faes; collectively the inhabitants thereof; an individual
                    such as a fairy
                    knight.[3] Faie became Modern English fay, while faierie
                    became fairy,
                    but this spelling almost exclusively refers to
                    one individual 
                    (the same
                    meaning as fay). In the sense of 'land
                    where fairies dwell',
                    archaic 
                    spellings faery and faerie are still in use.

                    Latinate fae, from which fairy derives, is distinct 
                    from English fey
                    (from Old English fǣġe), which means 'fated to die'.
                    [4] However, 
                    this unrelated Germanic word fey may have been
                    influenced by Old 
                    French fae (fay or fairy) as the meaning had shifted 
                    slightly to 
                    'fated' from the earlier 'doomed' or 'accursed'.[5]

                    Various folklore traditions refer to fairies
                    euphemistically as wee
                    folk, good folk, people of peace, fair folk 
                    (Welsh: Tylwyth Teg), etc.[6]
