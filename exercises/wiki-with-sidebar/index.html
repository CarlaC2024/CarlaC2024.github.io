                <h1>Fairy</h1>
                <p>
                    A fairy (also fay, fae, fey, fair folk, or faerie) is a
                    type of mythical being or legendary creature, generally 
                    described as anthropomorphic, found in the folklore of 
                    multiple European cultures (including Celtic, Slavic, 
                    Germanic, and French folklore), a form of spirit, often
                    with metaphysical, supernatural,
                    or preternatural qualities.

                    Myths and stories about fairies do not have a single 
                    origin, but are rather a collection of folk beliefs 
                    from disparate sources. Various folk theories about
                    the origins of fairies include casting them as 
                    either demoted angels or demons in a Christian 
                    tradition, as deities in Pagan belief systems, 
                    as spirits of the dead, as prehistoric precursors 
                    to humans, or as spirits of nature.

                <p>
                    The label of fairy has at times applied only to specific 
                    magical creatures with human appearance, magical powers,
                    and a penchant for trickery. At other times it has been 
                    used to describe any magical creature, such as goblins 
                    and gnomes. Fairy has at times been used as an adjective,
                    with a meaning equivalent to "enchanted" or "magical". 
                    It is also used as a name for the place these beings come
                    from, the land of Fairy.

                <h3>Etymology</h3>
                <p>
                    The English fairy derives from the Early Modern English
                    faerie, meaning 'realm of the fays'. Faerie, in turn,
                    derives from the Old French form faierie, a derivation 
                    from faie (from Vulgar Latin fata, 'the fates'), with 
                    the abstract noun suffix -erie.

                    In Old French romance, a faie or fee was a woman skilled 
                    in magic, and who
                    knew the power and virtue of words, of stones, 
                    and of herbs.[3]

                    Fairy was used to represent: an illusion or enchantment; 
                    the land of the 
                    Faes; collectively the inhabitants thereof; an individual
                    such as a fairy
                    knight.[3] Faie became Modern English fay, while faierie
                    became fairy,
                    but this spelling almost exclusively refers to
                    one individual 
                    (the same
                    meaning as fay). In the sense of 'land
                    where fairies dwell',
                    archaic 
                    spellings faery and faerie are still in use.

                    Latinate fae, from which fairy derives, is distinct 
                    from English fey
                    (from Old English fǣġe), which means 'fated to die'.
                    [4] However, 
                    this unrelated Germanic word fey may have been
                    influenced by Old 
                    French fae (fay or fairy) as the meaning had shifted 
                    slightly to 
                    'fated' from the earlier 'doomed' or 'accursed'.[5]

                    Various folklore traditions refer to fairies
                    euphemistically as wee
                    folk, good folk, people of peace, fair folk 
                    (Welsh: Tylwyth Teg), etc.[6]

                <h3>Historical development</h3>
                <p>
                    The term fairy is sometimes used to describe any
                    magical creature, including goblins and gnomes, while
                    at other times, the term describes only a specific 
                    type of ethereal creature or sprite.[7]

                    Explanations for the origins of fairies range from
                    Persian mythology[8] to the folklore of the Brythonic 
                    (Bretons, Welsh, Cornish), Gaelic (Irish, Scots, Manx),
                    and Germanic peoples, and from the pages of
                    Middle French medieval romances.
                            
                    According to some historians, such as Barthélemy
                    d'Herbelot, fairies were adopted from and influenced 
                    by the peris of Persian mythology.[9] Peris were 
                    angelic beings that were mentioned in antiquity in
                    pre-Islamic Persia as early as the Achaemenid Empire.
                    Peris were later described in various Persian works
                    in great detail such as the Shahnameh by Ferdowsi.
                    A peri was illustrated to be fair, beautiful, and
                    extravagant nature spirits that were supported
                    by wings. This may have influenced migratory 
                    Germanic and Eurasian settlers into Europe, 
                    or been transmitted during early exchanges.[10]
                    The similarities could also be attributed 
                    to a shared Proto-Indo-European mythology.[8]
                            
                    In the Middle Ages, fairie was used adjectivally, 
                    meaning "enchanted" (as in fairie knight, fairie 
                    queene), but also became a generic term for various 
                    "enchanted" creatures during the Late Middle English
                    period. Literature of the Elizabethan era conflated 
                    elves with the fairies of Romance culture, rendering
                    these terms somewhat interchangeable. The modern 
                    concept of "fairy" in the narrower sense is unique 
                    to English folklore, later made diminutive in 
                    accordance with prevailing tastes of the Victorian
                    era, as in "fairy tales" for children.
                            
                    The Victorian era and Edwardian era saw a heightened 
                    increase of interest in fairies. The Celtic Revival 
                    cast fairies as part of Ireland's cultural heritage.
                    Carole Silver and others suggested this fascination 
                    of English antiquarians arose from a reaction to 
                    greater industrialization and loss 
                    of older folk ways.[11]

                 <h3>Descriptions</h3>
                 <p>
                    Fairies are generally described as human in appearance 
                    and having magical powers. Diminutive fairies of various 
                    kinds have been reported through centuries, ranging from
                    quite tiny to the size of a human.[12] These small sizes
                    could be magically assumed, rather than constant.[13] 
                    Some smaller fairies could expand their figures to imitat
                    e humans.[14] On Orkney, fairies were described as short 
                    in stature, dressed in dark grey, and sometimes seen in 
                    armour.[15] In some folklore, fairies have green eyes.
                    Some depictions of fairies show them with footwear, 
                    others as barefoot. Wings, while common in Victorian 
                    and later artworks, are rare in folklore; fairies flew
                    by means of magic, sometimes perched on ragwort 
                    stems or the backs of birds.[16] Modern illustrations
                    often include dragonfly or butterfly wings.[17

                <h3>Origins</h3>
                <p>

                    Early modern fairies does not derive from a single
                    origin; the term is a conflation of disparate elements 
                    from folk belief sources, influenced by literature and 
                    speculation. In folklore of Ireland, the mythic 
                    aes sídhe, or 'people of the fairy hills', have come to
                    a modern meaning somewhat inclusive of fairies. 
                    The Scandinavian elves also served as an influence. 
                    Folklorists and mythologists have variously depicted 
                    fairies as: the unworthy dead, the children of Eve,
                    a kind of demon, a species independent of humans, 
                    an older race of humans, and fallen angels.[18] The
                    folkloristic or mythological elements combine Celtic,
                    Germanic and Greco-Roman elements. Folklorists have 
                    suggested that 'fairies' arose from various earlier
                    beliefs, which lost currency with the advent of
                    Christianity.[19] These disparate explanations are not 
                    necessarily incompatible, as 'fairies'
                    may be traced to multiple sources.

                <h3>Demoted angels</h3>
                <p>
                A Christian tenet held that fairies were a class of
                "demoted" angels.[20] One story described a group of
                angels revolting, and God ordering the gates of heaven 
                shut; those still in heaven remained angels, those in 
                hell became demons, and those caught in between became 
                fairies.[21] Others wrote that some angels, not being 
                godly enough, yet not evil enough for hell, were thrown
                out of heaven.[22] This concept may explain the tradition
                of paying a "teind" or tithe to hell; as fallen angels, 
                although not quite devils, they could be viewed
                as subjects of Satan.[23]
                King James I, in his dissertation Daemonologie,
                stated the term "faries" referred to illusory spirits 
                (demonic entities) that prophesied to, consorted with,
                and transported the individuals they served; in medieval
                times, a witch or sorcerer who had a pact with a familiar
                spirit might receive these services.[24]
