        Creme Brulee Stuffed French Toast, also known as Marry Me French Toast! 
        It's so good that if you make it for someone, they might just ask you to 
        marry them. The crackly sugar on top and the creamy vanilla bean custard
        in the center take ordinary French toast to not just the next level, 
        but 100 levels up.
